Color Flipper JavaScript Project

The ColorFlipper JavaScript project is a simple web application that allows users to generate random colors and apply them to the background of a designated area. 
This project serves as a fun and educational way to practice working with JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and create interactive user experiences.

Features :

Random Color Generation: With a single click of a button, users can generate a new random color. This feature can be used for various purposes, such as exploring different color palettes or simply having fun with colors.

Color Display: The generated color's hexadecimal code is displayed on the screen, making it easy for users to copy and use the color for their own projects.

Background Color Update: The background color of a designated area (e.g., the entire web page or a specific div) can be updated with the newly generated color, creating an interactive visual experience.
